# Welcome to Chonkie-inc! ðŸ‘‹

At Chonkie-inc, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern AI stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with tackling the text chunking problem, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

*   **[Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast chunking library. ðŸ¦›âœ¨

Beyond chunking, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas within the AI ecosystem, including:

*   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
*   Tokenizers
*   Embeddings & Embedding Models

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline the development process for AI practitioners.
