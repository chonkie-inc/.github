# Welcome to Chonkie-inc! ðŸ‘‹

</div>

At Chonkie-inc, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern AI stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with tackling the text chunking problem, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

- **[Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast chunking library. ðŸ¦›âœ¨

Beyond chunking, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas within the AI ecosystem, including:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Embeddings and Embedding Models
- Tokenizers

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline the development process for AI practitioners.
